# FandangoFraundDataAnalysis

Fandango is a movie ratings/review site similar to IMDB.

It was accused that Fandango gave higher ratings to films which were rated as mediocre or low. To find the amount of truth, I have performed a data analysis.

Attached are the data extracts and the analysis performed in Jupyter notebook.

This is a capstone project for a course in Udemy as well.
